## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Route Protection Flow
```
User requests protected route → Middleware checks auth → 
No auth: Redirect to /signin?next=<route> → 
Auth success: Redirect to original route
```

### Roadmap Data Flow  
```
AI Generation → API (/api/roadmap/generate) → 
Save to DB → Interactive Visualization → 
Progress Updates → API (/api/roadmap PUT) → 
Real-time UI updates
```

### Features Discovery
The navbar dynamically discovers features from:
- `app/` directory routes
- `components/FeatureCards.tsx` definitions
- Database feature tables

## 🚀 How to Test Locally

### 1. Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001 (or next available port)
```

### 2. Build Test
```bash  
npm run build
# ✅ Builds successfully with optimizations
```

### 3. Playwright Tests
```bash
# Install browsers if needed
npx playwright install

# Run specific test suites  
npx playwright test tests/navbar.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/interactions.spec.ts

# Run all tests
npx playwright test
```

### 4. Manual Testing Checklist
